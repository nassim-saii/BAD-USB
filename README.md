## ⚠️ Caution 
this project only for education proposes, this project helps on understanding how HID works and help on USB Hardening process.

## 💻 About the Project

EvilDuck is an open‑source hardware and software platform that implements HID (Human Interface Device) keyboard emulation to execute preconfigured payloads on host systems. Engineered as a low‑cost, fully customizable alternative to commercial tools (e.g., USB Rubber Ducky), the project leverages widely available microcontrollers and components to deliver repeatable, scriptable keystroke attacks for red‑team assessments, device hardening tests, and research. Designed for use in authorized security testing, EvilDuck provides a compact, extensible framework for developing and validating automated input‑based attack scenarios and mitigations.
